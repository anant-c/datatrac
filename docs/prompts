Right now I am building a CLI Application that will be managing Datasets on a server. I have build the CLI app and I have few functions. What I want you to do is to look at those functions and suggest me few dashboard type layouts or others interesting things that can be done. Always ask me questions before answering if that answer gives you more context. Always suggest me a better approach too. The following are the functions that I am using. Please have a look and then let me know about the web UI.
